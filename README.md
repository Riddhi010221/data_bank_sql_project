## Introduction
Neo-Banks, the new-age digital banks that operate entirely online, with no physical branches. Inspired by this shift, Danny envisions a revolutionary intersection between these digital banks, cryptocurrency, and the data world—leading to the launch of an exciting new initiative: Data Bank!

Data Bank functions like any other digital bank, but with a twist—it offers the world’s most secure distributed data storage platform. Customers are allocated cloud storage limits tied directly to the balance in their accounts. This unique business model comes with its own set of intriguing challenges, and that’s where the Data Bank team needs your expertise!

The management team at Data Bank is eager to expand their customer base and requires assistance in accurately tracking and forecasting their customers' data storage needs. This case study centers around developing key metrics, driving growth, and providing insightful analysis to help the business strategically plan for future developments.
